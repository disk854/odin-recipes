    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) box elbow macaroni</li>
        <li>¼ cup butter</li>
        <li>¼ cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>Black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>2 cups milk</li>
        <li>2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook elbow macaroni in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, 8 minutes.</li>
        <li>At the same time, melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat.</li>
        <li>Add flour, salt, and pepper and stir until smooth, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Pour in milk slowly, while stirring continuously. Continue to cook and stir until mixture is smooth and bubbling, about 5 minutes, making sure the milk doesn't burn.</li>
        <li>Add Cheddar cheese and stir until melted, 2 to 4 minutes.</li>
        <li>Drain macaroni and fold into cheese sauce until coated.</li>
        <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Quick note</h2>
    <p>You can never have enough cheese, and I usually add an extra 1/2 cup without ruining the recipe.</p>

    <p>Keep a careful eye on the milk when boiling, as milk boils fast and burns easily. Burnt milk will show up in the recipe's flavor if overcooked.</p>
